# go-color
go-color is a dummy package made to convert literal color such as 'yellow', 'orange' etc .... to hexa code, the package is also able to do the contrary operation (convert hexa code to literal color).

For now the supported color are the one used by CSS and they can be found here : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value

Please feel free to include the package in any of your project, or to make an issues or a pull request if you see any problem or want to make any changes.
